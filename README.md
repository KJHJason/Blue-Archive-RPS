# Blue-Archive-RPS

## Introduction

This project is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game made with assets from [Blue Archive The Animation](https://sh-anime.shochiku.co.jp/bluearchive-anime/) where you can play the rock paper scissors game with Arona, a character from the anime/game.

It is mainly a mini-project for me to learn how to create a simple game with React.
